### Hi there üëã

üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is **Josep Reverter**, and I am **passionate about Data Science and Data Analytics**. I have professional experience in a leading insurance firm in Spain, as well as in a small company working on an innovative and high-growth project.

üí¨ I've always enjoyed working on side projects outside of my job, whether it's taking courses, conducting research, reading articles, or **working on personal projects to improve my skills on a day-to-day basis**.

üî≠ **The aim of this repository is twofold**: it serves as a version control system for my personal projects, and also **a platform to showcase and consolidate all my work for sharing**. Visitors can explore, gather inspiration, and get insights into my working methods.

‚öΩ My hobbies are Football, Trekking, and Guitar.

### Projects

In the past few months, I've been working on **4 different personal projects**, and you can find them in the following repositories:

**1. FlatsHousesStudyBCN**: Where (1) I gather values and characteristics of real estate flats for sale in Barcelona, (2) conduct an end-to-end analysis and create a regression model, (3) analyze prices per square meter and by neighborhood, and (4) perform an analysis and extract interesting insights by correlating flat values with salaries and calculating mortgages.

**2. KaggleHousePricesPrediction**: Typical initial Kaggle competition. Really interesting Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.

**3. KaggleEnergyBehaviour**: Kaggle competition regression model to predict the energy consumption and production of costumers.

**4. KaggleFraudDetection**: Kaggle competition to predict credit-card fraud detection.

**5. ActionClassification**: My undergraduate thesis called "Football Action Classification using Face Emotion Features".
