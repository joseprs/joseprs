### Hi there 👋

🙋🏼‍♂️ My name is **Josep Reverter**, and I am **passionate about Data Science and Data Analytics**. I have professional experience in a leading insurance firm in Spain, as well as in a small company working on an innovative and high-growth project.

💬 I've always enjoyed working on side projects outside of my job, whether it's taking courses, conducting research, reading articles, or **working on personal projects to improve my skills on a day-to-day basis**.

🔭 The aim of this repository is twofold: it serves as a version control system for my personal projects, and also **a platform to showcase and consolidate all my work for sharing**. Visitors can explore, gather inspiration, and get insights into my working methods.
