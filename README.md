### Hi there üëã

üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è My name is **Josep Reverter**, and I am **passionate about Data Science and Data Analytics**. I have professional experience in a leading insurance firm, as well as in a start-upf working on an innovative and high-growth project. Currently working at Accenture as a Data Science Analyst.

üí¨ I've always enjoyed working on side projects outside of my job, whether it's taking courses, conducting research, reading articles, or **working on personal projects to improve my skills on a day-to-day basis**.

üî≠ **The aim of this repository is twofold**: it serves as a version control system for my personal projects, and also **a platform to showcase and consolidate all my work for sharing**. Visitors can explore, gather inspiration, and get insights into my working methods.

‚öΩ My hobbies are **Football, Trekking, and Guitar**.

### Projects

**1. FlatsHousesStudyBCN**: Where I build a **Flat Value Regressor** and I conduct an **end-to-end study and analysis of real estate properties for sale in Barcelona**. First, I develop the **data acquisition** process throug Web Scraping. Then, I create a **Flat Value Regressor** to predict the value of new properties, going through all the phases of a **Data Science project**. And finally, I perform analyses to extract interesting **conclusions** and **insights** about prices, mortgages, and neighborhoods.

**2. KaggleHousePricesPrediction**: Typical initial Kaggle competition. Really interesting Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering.

**3. KaggleEnergyBehaviour**: Kaggle competition regression model to predict the energy consumption and production of costumers.

**4. KaggleFraudDetection**: Kaggle competition to predict credit-card fraud detection.

**5. ActionClassification**: My undergraduate thesis called "Football Action Classification using Face Emotion Features".

**6. StolenMotorbikes**: Selection process test where I had to analyze the situation of stolen motorbikes in Spain during the last years to decide whether to push forward a functionality. Successfully passed.

**7. ProgrammingTest**: Programming test as part of a selection process. Successfully passed.
